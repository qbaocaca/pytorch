# i implement some CNN architectures in pytorch

most of my implementations are based on aladdin pearson and python engineer tutorials. they are very good sources of learning. please find them on youtube:

Lenet-5

Alexnet

VGG-16 

Resnet18

Googlenet

Mobilenetv1, v2, v3

Efficientnet

i have made some notes for quick understanding of the nets. it is titled notes_on_convnets.pdf

there is also a model training pipeline which I often used when training models. it is titled efficientnet_manual_on_hymeno.ipynb
