# i implement some CNN architectures in pytorch

my implementations are based on aladdin pearson and python engineer tutorials. they are very good sources of learning. please find them on youtube:

Lenet-5

Alexnet

VGG-16 

Resnet18

Googlenet

Mobilenetv1, v2, v3

Efficientnet

there are some notes for quick understanding of the nets: notes_on_convnets.pdf

there are lots of model training pipeline: ipynb_files

there is a project on Generative Adversarial Networks, GAN: GAN_project.pdf
